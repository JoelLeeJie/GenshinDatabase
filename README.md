# GenshinDB
A database meant to store character, weapon, artifact and material info from Genshin Impact.
May include a wpf for UI in the future.

Info from https://api.genshin.dev/ and Shiori.

GenshinDB - GenshinDB-RawData - GetRawData: GetRawDataProgram.cs takes data from https://api.genshin.dev/, and stores the data temporarily in RawData folder. It then converts the information and stores it in multiple csv files, one for each table, for copy.
